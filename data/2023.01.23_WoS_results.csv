Modelling time-series data of species abundances offers one approach to estimating response diversity (Ives et al., 2003) and has been used to estimate response diversity of herbivorous coral-reef fishes to (unmeasured) environmental fluctuations (Thibaut et al., 2012). Multivariate analyses offer another approach to estimating response diversity. Laliberté et al. (2010) used a multivariate analysis of a global dataset of plant communities to first define functional groups on the basis of effect traits, and then estimate response diversity to increasing land-use intensity as the multivariate within-group dispersion in response trait space.
