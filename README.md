# response_diversity_how_to_measure

Supplementary information report and data for the manuscript "How to measure response diversity", by Samuel RP-J Ross, Owen L Petchey, Takehiro Sasaki, and David W Armitage.

Folders in this repository:

-   `supplement`: contains the single Rmarkdown file for the supplementary information report (will also contain any files produced by this, e.g. the html report.)
-   `r`: any functions we make and use (best kept out of the Rmarkdown)
-   `data`: contains any data files, original or created, that we need.
-   `temp`: for temporary files that will be removed before public release. E.g., code develop and testing scripts (create one for yourself if you like); and the original Leary & Petchey material.
